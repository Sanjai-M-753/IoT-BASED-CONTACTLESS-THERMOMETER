# IoT-BASED-CONTACTLESS-THERMOMETER
A portable IoT-based contactless thermometer that measures body temperature using an infrared sensor and displays readings on an OLED screen. Data is sent to the Blynk cloud for live monitoring, and a buzzer alerts when temperature exceeds safe limits. Ideal for clinics and personal health use.

**Project Overview**
This project presents an IoT-based contactless thermometer that measures human body temperature using an infrared sensor and sends real-time data to the cloud through Wi-Fi. The system provides live monitoring on a mobile dashboard using Blynk, along with an OLED display and buzzer alert for abnormal temperatures.

**Components Used**
NodeMCU ESP8266
MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor
OLED Display (128×64)
Buzzer
3.7V Rechargeable Battery
Blynk IoT Cloud
