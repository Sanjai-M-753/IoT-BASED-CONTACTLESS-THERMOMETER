# IoT-BASED-CONTACTLESS-THERMOMETER
A portable IoT-based contactless thermometer that measures body temperature using an infrared sensor and displays readings on an OLED screen. Data is sent to the Blynk cloud for live monitoring, and a buzzer alerts when temperature exceeds safe limits. Ideal for clinics and personal health use.
